        <h5>How It Works</h5>
        <p>Miles is a parking reservation service. We partner with different facilities nationwide to provide you with tons of parking options and premium rates. While Miles does not own or operate any of these locations, we do work <em>very closely</em>            with the operators we partner with to ensure you have a seamless parking experience every time you park!<br> Any time you make a reservation with Miles, we send you a <strong><span>parking pass</span></strong> to the email address you provide.<br>            Your parking pass serves as your access pass to the facility.<br> Similar to how a hotel reservation works,<br> You can enter at any time after the start time listed on your Miles reservation bar, and you can depart at any time prior to the
            end time listed on your reservation. <strong><span>Please
            be aware that any time spent parked outside of your reservation is subject to your ticket</span></strong>, or an additional charge (at the drive-up rate) from the parking facility.
